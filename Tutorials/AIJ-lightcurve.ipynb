        "### What is an Eclipsing Binary?\n",
        "An **eclipsing binary** is a system of two stars orbiting each other in such a way that, from our line of sight on Earth, one star periodically passes in front of the other. This passage causes a dip in the total observed brightness of the system. Studying these eclipses tells us a lot about the stars' properties, like their sizes, masses, and temperatures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a Light Curve?\n",
        "A **light curve** is a graph that shows the brightness of an astronomical object over time. For an eclipsing binary, the light curve will show periodic dips in brightness corresponding to the eclipses. The shape and timing of these dips are crucial for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is AstroImageJ (AIJ)?\n",
        "**AstroImageJ (AIJ)** is a powerful, free, Java-based image processing and analysis software specifically designed for astronomy. It's widely used for tasks like photometry (measuring brightness), image calibration, and creating light curves. You can download it from the official AIJ website: [https://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/](https://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/)\n",
